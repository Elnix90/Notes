# 📝 Notes — Kotlin Android Test Project

### This is a small **test project** I built to learn **Kotlin** and **Android development** using **Jetpack Compose** and **Material 3**.


This project exists to help me:

- Practice Kotlin syntax and Android app structure
- Learn composable UI design and layout modifiers
- Understand theming and color schemes
- Get comfortable using Git, GitHub, and IntelliJ

---

This project is for **learning purposes only** — not a production-ready app.
Future updates may include:

* Real data persistence
* Editing and deleting notes
* Search functionality
